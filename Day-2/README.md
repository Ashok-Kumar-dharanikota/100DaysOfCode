# Data Structures and Algorithms 

## What is DSA?

DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics – Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must-have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.

## How to start learning DSA?
The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially.

The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:

Learn about Time and Space complexities
Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
Learn the basics of Algorithms
Practice Problems on DSA


## Learn about Complexities
Here comes one of the interesting and important topics. The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. How can you decide if a program written by you is efficient or not? This is measured by complexities. Complexity is of two types:

**Time Complexity**: Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
**Space Complexity**: Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 
You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
Both of the above complexities are measured with respect to the input parameters. But here arises a problem. The time required for executing a code depends on several factors, such as: 

The number of operations performed in the program, 
The speed of the device, and also 
The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform. 
So how can we determine which one is efficient? The answer is the use of asymptotic notation. 


* Big-O Notation (Ο) – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.
* Omega Notation (Ω) – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
* Theta Notation (θ) – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
